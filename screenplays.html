				<h3>Screenplays</h3>
				<p>A world like ours in which Shamans are common people who have gone to school for such a profession, and in which a lazy private detective must team up with the Shaman across the hall to solve a murder before the city falls under seige from the culprit.  A world in which a famous scientist discovers that his life-saving technological breakthrouh is actually killing peaceful intelligent creatures in another dimension.</p>
				<p>These are the worlds I have created for the silver screen.  Come take a closer look at my modern fantasy or my sci-fi adventure below.</p>

					<h3>A Consequence of Life</h3>
					<a href="ACoL.html"><img src="http://fillmurray.com/300/300"></a>
					<p>Dr. Tobias Haver has changed the world.  By discovering rift technology that bypasses Newton's Third Law of Motion, he has revolutionized safety practices around the globe. Plane and car fatalities are a thing of the past, with all the kinetic and thermal energy seemingly dissipated by these rifts.  Yet when Haver discovers that all that energy is actually being channeled into an alternate pocket dimension with a peaceful civilization suffering its effects, he must convince the world that his discovery is not as great as it seems.</p>
