This site is going to be a portfolio site of sorts for my creative writing.  I have a few short stories, novels, and screenplays in various stages of completion, and whether or not they're done, I'd like to display them possibly as "teasers" on my personal site. I will also include the status of each project on the site, and can update each project's page as I make progress on them.
